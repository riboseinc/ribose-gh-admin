. Assign an admin team for the specified repo

== Usage

       # Adds 'team_name' to 'repo_name' (under 'org_name')

       ribose-gh-admin create org_name repo_name team_name [description]
       # Creates a repo ('repo_name') with optional 'description' under
       # 'team_name', under 'org_name'

You'll also need to generate Github API tokens and set env vars:

  1) Make sure GITHUB_TOKEN & GITHUB_USER are set.
  2) Make sure GITHUB_TOKEN has admin:org scope (check its box during token
     generation in Web UI).
